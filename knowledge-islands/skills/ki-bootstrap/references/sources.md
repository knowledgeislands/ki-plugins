# Sources — ki-bootstrap

**Refresh:** canonical · on-change

Provenance only: the record of _what changed_ lives in git (the REFRESH commit), not a changelog here. This skill tracks no external spec — it is a Knowledge Islands install convention, re-anchored when the model it depends on changes (not on a clock).

† The coverage cascade is the set of `[ki-*]` tables the contract reads.

‡ Severity ladder, mode shape, checker contract.

§ This skill is the project-local counterpart of that convention.

## Last review

REFRESH last run **2026-07-07** — confirmed [CS]: an installed skill's `SKILL.md` with `argument-hint` already produces native `/ki-bootstrap audit|conform|refresh [path]` invocation; no wrapper command needed. [CP]/[CM] reviewed as the packaging contract `ki-binding` projects onto (see [sources.md](../../../environment/ki-binding/references/sources.md) for that skill's own review).

- [KR] `ki-repo` — Coverage cascade: every repo declares its foundations (`[ki-repo]` bedrock marker + `[ki-authoring]`) explicitly as `[ki-*]` tables; there is no injected/cascade-exempt baseline (ADR-KI-HARNESS-007). See `ki-config-standard.md` §44/§52.
- [KE] `ki-engineering` — **confirmed.** enforcement-framework §2 severity ladder and checker contract unchanged.
- [KH] `ki-harness` — **confirmed.** `ki:skills:link:project` convention and the `ki:skills:link:global` keystone install intact. **Correction (2026-07-14):** the documented `--all` harness variant was never implemented in `link-skills.ts`, whose own code encodes the opposite, reasoned design — the harness links only its declared coverage like any other repo. Docs (`SKILL.md`, `exemplars.md`) brought in line with the code rather than the reverse.
- [AH] README — **confirmed.** Keystone / global-install framing intact; skill count grew to twenty (generic `[ki-*]` model needs no edit).

### Open watch-items

- **Claude Code skill discovery** — the project-local model assumes `.claude/skills/` per session and `~/.claude/skills/` globally. Re-anchor if discovery locations or precedence change.
- **Codex CLI skill discovery** — `.agents/skills/` project-local and `~/.agents/skills/` global, declared via `[ki-repo] target_runtimes` (`SDR-KI-HARNESS-002`). Codex subagent (`[ki-agents]`) install is not wired yet — TOML under `~/.codex/agents/` needs a generator, not a symlink, pending the format spike. Re-anchor `runtimeSkillsDir`/`runtimeAgentsDir` in `package-scripts.ts` if Codex's own discovery paths or precedence change upstream.
- **The coverage cascade [KR]** — if `ki-repo` changes the `[ki-*]` table contract or adds cascade-exempt universals beyond `authoring`, update the baseline/link-set rule in the standard and `link-skills.ts`.
- **New sibling skills** — the harness skill set grew (e.g. `ki-handoffs`, 2026-06-21). The standard is generic over the set so needs no per-skill edit, but a harness `.claude/skills/` can lag behind newly added skills (BOOT-1 WARN); re-run `ki:skills:link:project`.
- **The `[ki-agents]` gate** — if agent discovery locations (`.claude/agents/`) or precedence change, re-anchor `link-agents.ts` alongside [CS].
